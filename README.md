# Project TreeKEA
This repository contains the TreeKea practice of the PRO2 subject (2018-Q2, spring season). 

We have applied **object-oriented programming** concepts to build this short project. This means that we have taken into account **modular design** and **object-based design**. We have used the **C++** programming language. We have applied new linear data structure like array o matrix and also tree data structure like binary tree for this practice.

The code is in the following folder called `src`

Note: we have used and configured **doxyfile** to keep record the code.
